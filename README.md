            <h3>My Major</h3>
           <p> 
               I'm currently a senior majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I applied to the Tippie College of business my second semester of sophomore year and was admitted!
               </p>
               In this major, I've been able to learn a lot of new skills, such as RStudio, Python, Access, and more. Something I wish I learned is how to use PowerBI.

           <h3>Post Grad Plans</h3>
               <p> After graduation, I'm moving down to Austin Texas to work for Memoryblue, a tech sales company.
               </p>
               <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>For fun, I like to read, play tennis, run, and (attempt) to cook sushi.
